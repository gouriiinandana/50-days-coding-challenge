Q. You are given a string s, which contains stars *.
In one operation, you can:
Choose a star in s.
Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.
Return the string after all stars have been removed.

#CODE:

class Solution {
public:
    string removeStars(string s) {
        std::stack<char> ss;
        for(char c:s){
            if(c=='*'){
                if(!ss.empty()) ss.pop();
            }
            else ss.push(c);
        }
        s="";
        while(!ss.empty()){
            s+=ss.top();
            ss.pop();
        }
        reverse(s.begin(),s.end());
        return s;
    }
};
