Q. Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of size 2 where:

answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2.
answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1.

  # CODE: python

  class Solution:
    def findDifference(self, nums1, nums2):
        s1, s2 = set(nums1), set(nums2)
        ans = [[], []]

        for i in s1:
            if i not in s2:
                ans[0].append(i)
        
        for i in s2:
            if i not in s1:
                ans[1].append(i)
        
        return ans
