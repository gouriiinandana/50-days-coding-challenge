You are given a positive integer array skill of even length n where skill[i] denotes the skill of the ith player. Divide the players into n / 2 teams of size 2 such that the total skill of each team is equal.

The chemistry of a team is equal to the product of the skills of the players on that team.

Return the sum of the chemistry of all the teams, or return -1 if there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.


# CODE: 

 class Solution {
public:
    long long dividePlayers(vector<int>& skill) {
        
        sort(skill.begin(), skill.end());
        
        int n = skill.size();
        int totalSkill = skill[0] + skill[n - 1]; 
        long long chemistrySum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            if (skill[i] + skill[n - i - 1] != totalSkill) {
                return -1; 
            }
            chemistrySum += (long long)skill[i] * skill[n - i - 1];
        }

        return chemistrySum; 
    }
};
